# AzureDatabrics-SparkForDataEngineers
I wanted to learn Azure Databricks so I can enhance my data engineering skills like data warehouse, clusters, Apache Spark, Authentication, Databricks File System (DBFS) and compute. and then use it for Streaming Analytics.

Azure Databricks is a unified, open analytics platform for building, deploying, sharing, and maintaining enterprise-grade data, analytics, and AI solutions at scale. The Databricks Data Intelligence Platform integrates with cloud storage and security in your cloud account, and manages and deploys cloud infrastructure on your behalf.

I'll be doing a project on building a Cloud Data platform for reporting and doing analysis of the data from Formula One Motorsport.
